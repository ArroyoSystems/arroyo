You've successfully installed {{ .Chart.Name }}!

This release is {{ .Release.Name }}

Once the release is fully deployed, you can navigate to the web ui by running

  $ open "http://$(kubectl get service/{{ .Release.Name }} -o jsonpath='{.spec.clusterIP}')"

(note this might take a few minutes if you are also deploying Postgres)

If that doesn't work (for example on MacOS or a remote Kubernetes cluster), you can also try

  $ kubectl port-forward service/{{ .Release.Name }} 5115:80

And opening http://localhost:5115 in your browser.
